Introduction:

Hi, I'm Mudz, currently residing in Sampaloc, Manila. I'm a Filipino with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

Over the past decade, I've accumulated extensive experience as an IT developer, starting in 2005 and continuing to the present. Initially, I worked with Visual Basic 6 Express desktop applciation for 5 years until 2010, followed by VB.NET also desktop application form until 2014. Since then, I've been immersed in C# ASP.NET framework, including ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Core, along with Angular framework UI development.

Previously, I was deployed to the Blueskies Project at Accenture in Taguig, Metro Manila, as an ASP.NET backend developer. My responsibilities included enhancing the existing API and designing new solutions from scratch, resolving API bugs, deploying updates, and supporting show-and-tell sessions.
