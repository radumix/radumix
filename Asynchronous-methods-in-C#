Asynchronous methods in C# use the async and await keywords to:
Run tasks in the background.
Keep the UI responsive (in desktop or web apps).
Improve scalability (in web apps like ASP.NET).
---Before async/await (introduced in C# 5.0), developers used:
    1. Callbacks / Delegates
client.DownloadStringCompleted += (s, e) => {
    string result = e.Result;
};
client.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri("https://example.com"));
