In ASP.NET C#, coupling refers to the degree of dependence between classes, modules, or components in an application. It's a concept from software design that measures how tightly 
connected different parts of your code are.
1. Definition
Coupling: How much one class/module relies on another.
Low (Loose) Coupling: Classes are independent; changes in one class rarely affect others.
High (Tight) Coupling: Classes are heavily dependent; changes in one class can break others.

2. Why It Matters
Maintainability: Loosely coupled code is easier to modify.
Reusability: Loosely coupled components can be reused in different projects.
Testability: Loosely coupled code is easier to unit test.

Types of Coupling
Tight Coupling
Example: Directly instantiating another class inside your class.
public class OrderService
{
    private PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService(); // tightly coupled
    public void ProcessOrder() 
    {
        paymentService.Pay();
    }
}

Loose Coupling
Achieved using interfaces, dependency injection, or events.
public interface IPaymentService
{
    void Pay();
}

public class PaymentService : IPaymentService
{
    public void Pay() { /* implementation */ }
}

public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IPaymentService _paymentService;
    public OrderService(IPaymentService paymentService)
    {
        _paymentService = paymentService; // loosely coupled
    }
    public void ProcessOrder() 
    {
        _paymentService.Pay();
    }
}
Now, OrderService depends on an interface, not a concrete class.
You can easily swap PaymentService with another implementation.


4. In ASP.NET C# Context
Controllers, Services, and Repositories should be loosely coupled.
Use Dependency Injection (DI) to reduce coupling.
Helps in:
Writing unit tests.
Making code changes without breaking other parts.
Following SOLID principles, especially the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
