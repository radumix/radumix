MVC:
Model-View-Controller is a design pattern that helps organize code by separating an application into three parts:

Model: Handles the data and business logic (like database access).

Controller: Defines the API endpoints. It receives HTTP requests, interacts with the Model, and returns data.

View: The View is the JSON (or XML) response returned to the client.
