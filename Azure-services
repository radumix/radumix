It provides real-time telemetry data, identifies issues, tracks user behavior, and delivers deep insights into application health, helping to optimize performance and quickly diagnose problems.

Azure Virtual Machine:Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing resources provided by Microsoft Azure. VMs allow you to run a wide range of operating systems and software in a virtualized environment without needing physical hardware. They provide flexibility for running applications, hosting websites, and performing computational tasks, with the ability to scale up or down based on demand. Azure VMs support various configurations and integrate seamlessly with other Azure services, offering full control over the virtualized infrastructure while providing high availability and security.
